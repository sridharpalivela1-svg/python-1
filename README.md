 Analog Clock Design Using Python

This project showcases a real-time analog clock built with Python's `tkinter` library. It features a circular clock face with hour markers and dynamically updating hour, minute, and second hands. The clock uses trigonometric calculations to position each hand accurately based on the current system time. The design is interactive and refreshes every second, demonstrating how Python can be used for graphical user interface (GUI) development and time-based animation.
